#Working With Git And Remote Repo

#first create a new repository: remote_repo
git clone [URL]	#copy the remote repo to machine
cd remote_repo
git status #origin/master is the clone of the remote master branch on machine
whatever > demo.txt
git add demo.txt
git commit -m "add a text file"
git status	#commit to localy
git push -u origin master	#send our updates to the remote repo
#The -u parameter tells Git to set origin/master as the upstream repo and means
#we don't have to keep specifying it from now on.
git status	#already in sync

#then make some changes on demo.txt(remote)
git fetch origin #checking for updates on that remote repo
git remote -v #show that origin is pointing to remote repo on github
git status	#reveals that edit we did on the server behind by 1 commit
git pull	#incorporates the changes from a remote repository into the current branch.

#the make some changes on demo.txt(locally)
git add demo.txt
git commit -m "update from local copy"
git fetch origin #reveal whether more changes have happened on the server since you last sync
git status	#we are now ahead of the remote repo by one commit. 
git push	#publish our local commits,done!
